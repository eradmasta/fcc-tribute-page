          Richard P. Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, known for
          his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the
          theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the
          superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle
          physics for which he proposed the parton model. For contributions to
          the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel
          Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichir≈ç
          Tomonaga.

          Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for
          the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic
          particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his
          lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the
          world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the
          British journal <em>'Physics World'</em> he was ranked as one of the
          ten greatest physicists of all time.

          He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II
          and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the
          Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle
          Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics,
          Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum
          computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the
          Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the
          California Institute of Technology.

        <section id="section4">
          Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and
          lectures including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called
          <em>'There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom'</em> and the three-volume
          publication of his undergraduate lectures,
          <em>'The Feynman Lectures on Physics'</em>. Feynman also became known
          through his semi-autobiographical books
          <em>'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!'</em> and
          <em>'What Do You Care What Other People Think?'</em> and books written
          about him such as <em>'Tuva or Bust!'</em> by Ralph Leighton and the
          biography
          <em>'Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman'</em> by James
          Gleick.
